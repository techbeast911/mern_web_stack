### Setting Up a Full-Stack Todo Application on EC2: A Journey with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React

#### Introduction

Embarking on the journey to set up a full-stack Todo application on an Amazon EC2 instance involves a myriad of steps, including configuring the backend with Node.js and Express, connecting to a MongoDB database, and creating a frontend with React. This essay chronicles the detailed process, challenges, and solutions encountered during the setup, offering insights into each component's role and the intricacies involved in creating a seamless application.

#### Backend Configuration with Node.js and Express

The initial phase involves setting up the backend using Node.js and Express. Express, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. The setup begins with creating an Express server and defining routes for handling CRUD operations on Todo items. This includes routes for retrieving all todo items, adding a new todo, and deleting a todo item by its ID.

#### Database Connection with MongoDB

Connecting to MongoDB involves configuring the `mongoose` package to connect to a MongoDB Atlas cluster. This requires defining the connection string in a `.env` file and loading it using the `dotenv` package. However, an error was encountered due to the MongoDB URI not being correctly retrieved from the environment variables. Ensuring the `.env` file had the correct MongoDB URI and verifying its retrieval resolved the issue.

#### Handling Port Conflicts

An error indicating that the port was already in use highlighted the need to handle port conflicts. Identifying the process occupying the port and killing it resolved the conflict, allowing the server to run successfully.

#### Setting Up the Frontend with React

Creating the frontend involved setting up a React application within the project directory. The frontend communicates with the backend via the defined API routes. However, during setup, running the React app setup command appeared to freeze. This issue was resolved by ensuring the environment had sufficient resources and network connectivity.

The React application consists of components such as `Input` for adding todos and `ListTodo` for displaying them. The `Todo` component manages the state and handles API interactions, including fetching todos from the backend and deleting todos.

#### Proxy Configuration

Configuring the proxy in the React app's `package.json` file ensures API requests during development are proxied to the backend server. This configuration helps in seamless communication between the frontend and backend during development.

#### Conclusion

Setting up a full-stack Todo application on an EC2 instance involves configuring the backend with Express, connecting to a MongoDB database, and creating a React frontend. Each step presents unique challenges, from handling port conflicts to ensuring seamless API communication between the frontend and backend. By methodically addressing these challenges and ensuring proper configuration, a robust and functional Todo application can be deployed successfully on an EC2 instance. This journey highlights the importance of meticulous setup and troubleshooting in full-stack development.
